# MyReads

"MyReads" is an application which allows a user to create and manage a reading list. This reading list is divided into three "shelves": 1. Want To Read 2. Currently Reading 3. Finished Reading

A user is able to add/remove books from their list, as well as move books to different sections, e.g., moving a book from the "Currently Reading" shelf to the "Finished Reading" shelf.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through cloning and running MyReads on your local machine.

##### NOTE

2. Install dependencies

- You have the codebase for the application, but you still need to download the rest of the tools, libraries, etc... that this application makes use of in order to run it properly.
