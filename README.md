# MyReads

"MyReads" is an application which allows a user to create and manage a reading list. This reading list is divided into three "shelves": 1. Want To Read 2. Currently Reading 3. Finished Reading

A user is able to add/remove books from their list, as well as move books to different sections, e.g., moving a book from the "Currently Reading" shelf to the "Finished Reading" shelf.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through cloning and running MyReads on your local machine.
